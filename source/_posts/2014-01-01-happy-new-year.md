Hi guys, new year and new blog!
After some time I moved my Drupal website to a more "static" site hosted on S3.
This is a compelte rewrite of my blog using [Sculpin](http://sculpin.io/) with the awesome support of [@beausimensen](http://twitter.com/beausimensen).
<!--break-->
This new blog is also a new challenge, I start to study Sculpin as a new website genrator, and [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com) as a content delivery.

I also have a new intentions for this new year:

 - One blog post a week
 - One PR a week

Can I do it? Let's me try! :)

## Have a fun 2014!
